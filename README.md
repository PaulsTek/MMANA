Anyone can create public and private branches as long as they comply with the LGPL rules. As of August 2013, the only Committer is JA7UDE Oba, but in the future, if anyone is willing to cooperate with the operation and management, we will respond at any time.

The original MMANA was developed with Borland C++ Builder version 3.0, a development environment that was discontinued over ten years ago. So getting version 3.0 is quite difficult. Considering that the MMANA source code can be used effectively by as many people as possible, we have rewritten the source code so that it can be built with XE4, the latest version of C++ Builder (as of August 2013).

There are several versions of C++ Builder XE4, but you can build with the cheapest C++ Builder XE4 Starter ESD. Also, there seems to be a free trial version for a limited time, so it seems that there is also a way to try using it for the time being.
